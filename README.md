This repository contains all frontend and backend code for an iOS app I wrote in Swift to learn mobile development. The Serverless-deployable backend consists of AWS Node Lambdas and one AWS DynamoDB table that logs usage so the app can eventually implement a freemium model.

Dictpic is live on the App Store as of April 19, 2019, but I may remove it in June because I don't have time to migrate away from a dependency that's getting deprecated.
