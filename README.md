This repository contains all frontend and backend code for an iOS app I wrote in Swift to learn mobile development. The backend consists of Node and Python AWS lambdas, Serverless to deploy code, and one AWS DynamoDB table that logs usage so the mobile app can - eventually - implement a freemium model.

Dictpic is live on the App Store as of April 19, 2019, but I may remove it in June because I don't have time to migrate away from a dependency that's getting deprecated.
